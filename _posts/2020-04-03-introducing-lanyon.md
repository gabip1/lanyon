##### "It's not a real party until the cops show up" - a phrase many of us have heard, and one that has been immortalized in countless movies and books as the hallmark of a legendary bash. Take "Project X" (2012), for instance: the ultimate party fantasy, complete with a car in the pool and a police shutdown via helicopter.

Yet, the reality of hosting such epic parties isn't always kind to our wallets, especially when fines and New York City-level rents are in the mix. The result? A potential headache, both financially and from any overindulgence in alcohol. So, how does one strike the perfect balance between becoming the host of the century and staying off the NYPD's radar? Fear not, we've got your friend group covered.

We - your dedicated team of party scientists - have combined our brainpower to craft the ultimate NYC house party guide. How did we do it? By diving into the NYC's OpenData 311 Service Requests from 2010 to Present dataset. It turns out that pinpointing the residences of the most active party poopers is an excellent starting point. We analyzed the data on "Loud Music/Party" noise complaints at residential buildings, searching for patterns and dividing our analysis by NYC's ZIP code areas.

Our guide answers pressing questions: Which areas receive the most complaints? Where's the Tuesday night hotspot in July? Should the party be at your place or Sarah's? Plus, we've even dabbled in machine learning (because what's a 2024 article without a nod to AI?) to predict the best time to dial down the music and keep the party police-free. But remember, our advice comes with a disclaimer: use it wisely and sparingly.

With introductions aside, behold the interactive map in Figure 1. This guide can be used in two ways: for a broad view of NYC's party landscape or for targeted party planning by selecting potential ZIP codes. The map highlights the safest bets for your next shindig—the lighter the area, the fewer complaints it's had.

A glance at the map reveals that the Bronx and the Brooklyn-Queens border are hotspots for noise complaints. The Bronx ZIP code area 10467 leads with 29,255 complaints over the years, closely followed by Brooklyn's 11221 and 11226, each with over 28,000. Our tip? Steer clear of these areas if you're hosting.

Seasonal patterns are also evident. The Bronx dominates complaints in the colder months, while Brooklyn takes over in the warmer ones. Weekends, particularly Saturdays (and the resulting Sunday mornings), unsurprisingly see the most action.

Figure 2 showcases our machine learning model's interface, predicting the likely time of your first noise complaint based on the month, weekday, and ZIP code. Our suggestion? Lower the volume at the predicted time or move the festivities indoors.

And there you have it—the NYC house party survival guide. May it aid you in planning your next epic event or, at the very least, provide a solid excuse for why the party shouldn't be at your place, Sarah.

Happy (and safe) partying!
