##### In the buzzing metropolis of New York City, the cacophony of urban life never seems to quiet down. Yet, in the constant buzz of activity, lies a source of noise that often goes overlooked: construction sites. With the city in a perpetual state of evolution, construction companies are omnipresent, reshaping the skyline and the streets below. However, as the city thrums with progress, complaints from weary residents paint a different picture—one of sleepless nights, disrupted routines, and frayed nerves. 

In this tale of urban life, our investigation looks into the intersection of citizen complaints logged through the 311 NYC hotline and the official permits granted for construction work. 
Through this combination of data, the aim is clear: to shine a spotlight on the practices of construction companies, debunk the worst offenders, and reveal the busiest hotspots in the city. Let's discover why NYC never sleeps. 

In 2023 alone, NYC officials issued a staggering 14,424 construction work permits for 1,028 companies. During the same period, residents of the city lodged a remarkable 31,615 noise complaints related to construction site works. These numbers underscore the sheer magnitude of the problem and the significant impact it has on the daily lives of New Yorkers.

The graph below sheds light on the companies that garnered the most complaints. The complaints primarily revolved around noise, including construction before/after hours, construction equipment noise, jack hammering.Particularly intriguing is the revelation that the top company, despite operating on only 151 job permits, received a staggering 120 times more complaints than the number of permits it held.

The heatmap below offers an overview of construction-related noise complaints across New York City throughout the year 2023, delineated by monthly intervals. This visualisation further proves that no area in particular can be save from unwanted construction site noise in the city.
